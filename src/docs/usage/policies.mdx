Policies consist of a definition of sensitive data and a set of rules specifying how the data can be accessed, expressed in YAML format. Here is an
example policy along with descriptions of each field.

```yaml
sensitiveAttrs:
  - card_number
  - credit_limit
  - card_family
locations:
  - repo: invoices
    schema: finance
    table: cards
rules:
  - identities:
      - scientist
    reads:
      allow: true
      attributes: ["*"]
      rows: 10
    updates:
      allow: true
      attributes:
        - credit_limit
      rows: 1
    deletes:
      allow: true
      rows: 1
defaultRule:
  reads:
    allow: true
    attributes:
    rows: 1
  updates:
    allow: false
  deletes:
    allow: false
```

A policy can be broken into two sections: _data specification_, comprising fields `sensitiveAttrs` and `locations`; and _data access rules_, comprising fields `rules` and `defaultRule`.

## Data Specification

Users specify sensitive data to be managed by the policy through two fields:

- `sensitiveAttrs` is the dataset managed by the policy
- `locations` is the set of locations where the dataset exists each location is defined by the repository, schema, and table containing the dataset entered in fields `repo`, `schema`, and `table`, respectively.

In the following example, we specify that attributes `card_number`, `card_family`, and `credit_limit` are sensitive and exist in table cards under the schema playground in the clinics repository as well as in the `credit` repository.

```yaml
sensitiveAttrs: [card_number, card_family, credit_limit]
locations:
  - repo: credit
    schema: playground
    table: cards
  - repo: clinics
    schema: playground
    table: cards
```

## Data Access Rules

Users can manage how sensitive data can be accessed by specifying data access rules.

A data access rule comprises these fields:

- `reads`, `updates`, and `deletes` respectively specify restrictions on reads, updates, and deletes of sensitive data. For each action, a user can specify these fields:
  - `allow` is `true` when the action is allowed, and `false` otherwise
  - `attributes` is the set of sensitive attributes for which the action is allowed
    - the value `["*"]` is used to specify that all attributes can be accessed
    - allowed attributes are only specified for `read` and `update` actions, because attributes cannot be selectively deleted without deleting the row
  - `rows` specifies the maximum numbers of rows that can be accessed or affected by the action
    - the value `-1` is used to specify that there is no limit on the amount of rows that can be accessed identities is the set of entities affected by the rule
  - `identities` is the set of entities affected by the rule
    - this field is not specified for the default rule, which applies to accesses that do not match any of the identities specified by rules in the `rules` field

For example, the following rule dictates that the identity `scientist` can read up to 10 rows of any attributes, update a single row of the attribute `credit_limit`, and is prohibited from deleting any sensitive data managed by the policy containing this rule.

```yaml
identities:
      - scientist
    reads:
      allow: true
      attributes: ["*"]
      rows: 10
    updates:
      allow: true
      attributes:
        - credit_limit
      rows: 1
    deletes:
      allow: true
      rows: 1
```

A single policy can have several such rules specified in the field rules, as well as a rule that applies to any identities that arenâ€™t covered by
those rules specified in the field `defaultRule`.
